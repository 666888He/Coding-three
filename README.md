# Coding-three
(Final Project) Exploring to Machine Intelligence

Import the required library.
Define function image_ to_ data, used to load image data and perform preprocessing, returning the processed dataset X_ Train.
Define function build_ discriminator, create a discriminator model.
Define function build_ generator, create a generator model.
Create instances of discriminators and generators.
Define optimizer and Loss function.
Define the Loss function of discriminator.
Define the Loss function of the generator.
Define function show_ and_ save_ images, used to display and save images generated by the generator.
Define function train_ step, used to execute training steps.
Define the training dataset and the number of iterations for training.
Conduct training iterations and execute training steps in each iteration cycle.
Every 100 cycles, call generate_ and_ save_ images function generates and saves the images generated by the generator.
Print the current iteration cycle.
The above is the basic logic of the code. It uses GAN to train the generator and discriminator model to generate realistic images. Please note that variables and functions in the code may be interdependent, and only a rough logical structure is provided here.
